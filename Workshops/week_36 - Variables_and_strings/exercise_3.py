Exercise 3

Write a program that calculates the restaurant tab for a person with a 
gift certificate. 

The program should:
   - prompt the user for the amount spent on appetizer, entr√©e, dessert and 
     drinks, and for the amount on the gift certificate. 
   - display both the final tab to the customer, as well as the amount paid 
     in sales tax (assume a sales tax of 25 %).
